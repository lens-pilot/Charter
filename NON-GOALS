# Non-Goals

Project LENS intentionally does **not** pursue the following goals at this stage.

## Immediate Operation of a University

Project LENS is not attempting to immediately launch or operate a full, accredited university. Any resemblance to a functioning institution is exploratory and provisional.

## Open Enrollment or Public Participation

Project LENS is not an open-enrollment program. Participation, if any, is limited, controlled, and purposefully selective in order to support research validity and operational safety.

## Credential or Degree Issuance

Project LENS does not currently issue degrees, credentials, certificates, or transcripts. No academic credit or professional recognition should be inferred.

## Replacement of Existing Institutions

Project LENS is not designed to replace traditional universities, online education platforms, or professional training programs. It is an investigation into alternative models, not a competitor.

## Rapid Scaling

Project LENS does not prioritize growth, scale, or reach. Expanding participation or scope without evidence of safety, rigor, and sustainability is considered a failure mode.

## Guaranteed Outcomes

Project LENS makes no guarantees regarding educational quality, completion rates, employability, accreditation, or long-term viability.

## Monetization or Commercialization

Project LENS is not pursuing tuition, fees, subscriptions, or commercial revenue models during the pilot phase.

## Platform or Technology Product Development

While technology may be developed incidentally, Project LENS is not a software startup, SaaS product, or platform company.

Excluding these goals is intentional.  
They introduce pressures that would compromise the validity of the experiment.
