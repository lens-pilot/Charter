# Assumptions

Project LENS operates under the following assumptions. These are not asserted as facts; they are working hypotheses to be tested through controlled pilots.

## Learning Through Contribution

Students develop deeper understanding and longer-lasting mastery when they actively contribute to the learning process, including teaching, reviewing, and producing academic materials.

## Peer Assessment Can Be Rigorous

With clear rubrics, structured incentives, and oversight, peer assessment can achieve reliability and rigor comparable to traditional instructor-led grading for many forms of coursework.

## Motivation Can Be Non-Monetary

Meaningful participation, recognition, responsibility, and progression can motivate sustained, high-quality academic labor without direct financial compensation.

## Academic Roles Can Be Fluid

The strict separation between “student,” “teaching assistant,” and “instructor” is not strictly necessary for rigor, provided authority boundaries and escalation paths are explicit.

## Expertise Is Still Required

Domain experts remain essential for curriculum design, boundary setting, dispute resolution, and standards enforcement, even in highly distributed instructional models.

## Tooling Is Secondary to Structure

Clear processes, expectations, and governance matter more than bespoke technical platforms. Widely available tools can suffice when used deliberately.

## Small Pilots Reveal Truth

Failure modes, incentives, and unintended consequences are more effectively discovered through small, time-boxed cohorts than through theoretical design alone.

## Not All Disciplines Are Equal

Some fields are more compatible with distributed, contribution-based pedagogy than others. Early exploration should favor disciplines with strong feedback loops and artifact-based evaluation.

If these assumptions prove false, Project LENS should change direction or stop.
