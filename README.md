# Project LENS — Charter

This repository defines the canonical scope, intent, constraints, and terminology of **Project LENS**.

It is the authoritative reference for:
- What Project LENS *is*
- What Project LENS *is not*
- The assumptions under which Project LENS operates
- How related repositories, experiments, and documents should be interpreted

This repository is intentionally stable and changes infrequently.  
Other Project LENS repositories may evolve rapidly; this one should not.

Nothing in this repository constitutes an offer, promise, or commitment of any kind.
