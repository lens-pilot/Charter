# Scope

Project LENS is a pilot initiative exploring whether a rigorous, accredited-style university model can be constructed and operated using predominantly volunteer labor and open, network-native tools.

The scope of Project LENS includes:

- Designing and documenting a pedagogy centered on learning-through-contribution, where students build mastery by:
  - Answering questions
  - Reviewing and assessing peer work
  - Creating and maintaining learning materials
  - Participating in structured academic service roles

- Defining academic structures such as:
  - Courses and syllabi
  - Degree plans
  - Prerequisites and progression rules
  - Evaluation and assessment mechanisms

- Experimenting with governance and operations models in which:
  - Most instructional and administrative functions are performed by students
  - Domain experts (“professors”) provide oversight, moderation, curriculum design, and dispute resolution
  - Authority is explicit, limited, and documented

- Leveraging existing, widely available platforms and infrastructure (e.g., version control systems, discussion forums, public media platforms) where appropriate, rather than building bespoke systems prematurely

- Running small, controlled pilot cohorts to evaluate feasibility, risks, and failure modes before any attempt at scaling

Project LENS is explicitly a **research and pilot effort**. Its purpose is to test assumptions, surface constraints, and generate evidence — not to immediately operate a full university.

Questions of accreditation, credential recognition, funding models, long-term institutional form, and public enrollment are intentionally deferred unless and until pilot results justify further exploration.
